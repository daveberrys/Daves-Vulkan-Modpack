<h1> Dave's Vulkan Modpack </h1>
<p> Just a performance and survival modpack I made for fun. </p>

<details>
  <summary>I need help!</summary>
  <h2> The game freezes when loading into a world! </h2>
  <p> Try keep on restarting, If the issue presists. Please make a Issue. </p>

  <h2> Does Windows, Linux or MacOS work? </h2>
  <p> I can confirm linux works, but I'm not sure about MacOS and Windows. </p>

  <h2> My flowers when holding them are just black! </h2>
  <p> This is probably a HMI (Hold My Items) Issue. I have no ideas why it does this. </p>

  <h2> My chunks keeps on reloading! </h2>
  <p> Try rejoining the game, F3 + T or relaunch the game. </p>

  <h2> I have another issue thats not here! </h2>
  <p> Make a Issue in <a href="https://github.com/daveberrys/Daves-Vulkan-Modpack/issues">Here.</a> </p>
